In Taoism, "Fasting of the Heart" (xinzhai 心齋) is a spiritual practice described in the *Zhuangzi*, a foundational Taoist text. It involves emptying the mind of desires, judgments, and distractions to achieve inner unity and align with the Dao, the natural way of the universe. Unlike physical fasting, it focuses on mental and spiritual clarity, freeing the practitioner from ego-driven thoughts and sensory overload.

The concept appears in a dialogue between Confucius and his disciple Yan Hui, where Confucius advises Yan Hui to "fast" his heart-mind before attempting to influence others. This means transcending ordinary perception—moving beyond hearing with the ears or understanding with the mind to "hearing with the spirit" or the whole being. By emptying the faculties, one becomes receptive to the Dao, achieving a state of stillness and non-action (wuwei), where the universe's natural flow takes over.

Practically, fasting of the heart involves abstaining from intellectual overactivity, judgmental thinking, and sensory stimulation. It’s akin to a mental detox, calming the "monkey mind" and fostering inner peace. The practice aligns with Taoist meditation techniques like *zuowang* (sitting in oblivion), emphasizing emptiness and unity over distinction-making (e.g., good vs. bad). This clarity allows one to act spontaneously in harmony with the Dao, without forcing outcomes.

For example, in the *Zhuangzi*, Confucius suggests Yan Hui’s plans to reform a kingdom are ego-driven and likely to fail. Instead, fasting the heart would help Yan Hui see the futility of intervention, letting events unfold naturally, as Lao Tzu’s quote, “For those who practice not-doing, everything will fall into place,” implies.

The practice remains relevant today, offering a way to counter modern overstimulation and reconnect with one’s higher self, promoting freedom from preoccupation and a deeper connection to the natural flow of life.[](https://einzelganger.co/the-fasting-of-the-heart/)[](https://elizabeth-reninger.com/fasting-of-the-heart-mind/)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuowang)
